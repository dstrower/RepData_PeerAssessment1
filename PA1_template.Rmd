## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
#lets create a dataframe that only includes valid step values (ie. no NA)
validData <- activityData[!is.na(activityData$steps),]
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(validData)
aggregatedByDate <- DT[, sum(steps), by = date]
aggregatedByInterval <- DT[, sum(steps), by = interval]
setnames(aggregatedByDate,'V1','steps')
setnames(aggregatedByInterval,'V1','steps')
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist(aggregatedByDate$steps)
mean(aggregatedByDate$steps)
median(aggregatedByDate$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
plot(aggregatedByInterval$interval,aggregatedByInterval$steps)
````


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
